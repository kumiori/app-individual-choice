In contrast to a dominating and dominant view of eros, which often oversimplifies and underestimates its richness and complexity, this collaborative project seeks to amplify diverse voices and perspectives on the subject. In patriarchal societies, eros is frequently confined to narrow and predefined roles, reinforcing rigid gender norms and power dynamics.

By inviting to participate in this exploration, we challenge the patriarchal constraints placed on eros and celebrate its multifaceted nature. Through this inclusive dialogue, we aim to dismantle outdated paradigms and foster a deeper understanding of eros as a universal force that transcends societal constructs and embraces the full spectrum of human experience.


Patriarchal constraints on eros reinforce hierarchical power structures, restrict individual agency and autonomy, and perpetuate harmful stereotypes and inequalities based on gender and sexuality. Overcoming these constraints requires challenging and dismantling patriarchal norms and advocating for inclusive, equitable, and empowering expressions of eros for all individuals.

On a societal level, the connection between eros and sex shapes cultural norms, attitudes, and behaviors surrounding sexuality and relationships. Eros often intersects with social constructs such as gender, power, and morality, influencing societal perceptions of sexuality and acceptable forms of expression. The commodification and commercialization of sex in media, advertising, and entertainment reflect societal attitudes toward eros, often reinforcing narrow and objectifying representations of desire and intimacy.

### The Project
We commit to making this project self-funded. We establish a connection with participants in such a way that contributions are innovative and engaging. By incorporating audio recordings from participants, we create a dynamic and interactive platform that invites viewers to not only listen but also actively engage with the content.

Eros plays a role in every process of emancipation.
Eros plays a role in every process of liberation.
Eros plays a role in every process of awakening,
