Sometimes, sadness has an underlying reason which is the feeling of uncertainty regarding our future life together.

Therefore, let's to discuss our future in an intentional and clear way.

I have chosen you as my life partner and I am feeling very sure about this choice, plus I feel I'm at the stage of my life where I want to build a nest and grow long-lasting roots and I want to do it with you.

I want to be able to project myself in the future with you, and this thought keeps coming in, sometimes making me feel lost because there is nothing tangible to grasp.

I feel like each time we discuss it I am left in some way comforted and reassured and, in many ways, confused and not relieved.

I would therefore like to discuss this openly and very clearly to know our potential timeline as a couple. 

(This being said, it doesn't mean that I want to change anything right now or in the very near future, but within the next year ‚Äì definitely):
