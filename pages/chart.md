You did the illustrations, and they wanted to, like, design the illustrations. And this is just inspiring me to just, you know, I mean, make it. Wow.

You guys have two nice things in common. 

You guys both have your Venus and Mercury and Scorpio. Let's see.. 

And Pluto, but... You both have Venus and Mercury and Scorpio.

So, we'll just... We can look at both the aspects, but basically, the chart is divided into these 12 houses, right? Like, the 12 pieces of pie. And basically, what determines it is what your ascendant is.

Your ascendant is the constellation that was rising above the eastern horizon at the moment you were born. And that changes signs every two hours.

So, it's the most personal point of the chart. And your ascendant will also determine what your first house is. 

So, the houses represent all the different areas of life in our being.

First house is like self-body identity. 
Fifth house is love, pleasure, and recreation. 
Tenth house is, you know, your public image in some way and success the way that you're seen in the world.

Eleventh house, and this is what's so nice, all this eleventh house and Aquarius stuff going on. 

Eleventh house is the house of hopes and dreams and technology, breaking the mold, science, anything that's like a bit freaky and forward thinking.

So, you get the idea. 
All of these houses represent something. 

So, the sign that the planets are in is going to determine sort of like the personality of how that planet expresses itself.

And the house determines where that plays out, in what area of life it plays out in. 

So, first things first, having your Aquarius rising. 

If our ascendant, to me, is sort of how we like express our energy in the world, it's the filter that your whole chart goes through.

A lot of people think of it or look at it as like the face that we wear to the world, or like how people will first perceive us. And I really believe that's also true.

It's very much like what we wear on the outside, but it's not a mask. 

It's like because there's this filter on all of it that's sort of guiding the ship.

So, your ascendant guides the ship. 

Yours is an Aquarius. 

Aquarius is the sign ruled by Uranus, which is the planet in astrology of... 

It's the rebel planet. It's the freethinker.
It's technology. It's science. It's creative, but in a very practical, not-practical, rational sort of way. 

It's rationalism as creativity. 

So, the first thing that's so nice to see is just like you having your Aquarius rising right away.

It's the number one rising sign where people meet you and they're like, oh, you're a little different, you know? 

And you can't help it. You must lead your life in a way that is just a little fucking different, you know?

At least a little. 

At least a little different. 

And it's really about like breaking the mold, but in a way that is very future oriented. 

In a way that's like, "I don't give a shit what came before".

And you've got some capricorn going on, so there is a part of you that can use tradition to break molds, but very much your mission in this life with an Aquarius rising is to like, yeah, break the mold in a way where you bring in the future by using your creativity in a rational way.

And then you have, okay, of course your sun in the first degrees of Scorpio. You just made it. Just a Scorpio. You're definitely not a Libra. 

But you have many planets in Scorpio.
So you have Mercury in Scorpio. You have Venus in Scorpio. And Scorpio is another sign of transformation. 

It's another sign that doesn't give a shit about what has to be torn down as long as you're building something better in its place.

So I really think that there's something in this lifetime for you about transformation, you know? Like taking what's there and transforming it into something future, something deeper, something better.

Scorpio is ruled by the planet Pluto, which is the planet of intensity, of death, of sex, of transformation. So those themes in your life are very important.

You love that way. You think that way. Your sun is there. 

So basically the core of your personality is in this sign that has a very strong intuition but uses it in a way that's not just like dreaminess.

It's "appointed intuition", you know? And you've got your Jupiter and Pisces, and so that's a very dreamy position. 

But like there's something about your creativity that is very much, it's like laser focus.

And even if it's all over the place, in the thing that you're focusing on, you laser focus on it. 

And all of that's happening in your tenth house.

So that, say, when you have a lot of tenth house activity in a chart that says that in many ways you are meant to do what you do in a way that is not just for you but is for the public.

So it's really funny that you're like talking about how you don't release things often or it's just that it sits in the bag. 

That should probably change and it will at some point in your life because it's very much a part of your purpose and a part of what you're capable of and the best that you can offer this world is to actually let yourself be seen. 

There should be a public facing aspect of your life on some level.

And the other magical thing, so you have your Saturn and Uranus in Sagittarius but what's really interesting, again, is that Uranus, which is the planet associated with Aquarius that we were talking about, is basically in the house of Uranus.

So 11th house is ruled by that planet and you have that planet in there. 

So Uranus in your chart is super powered. 

It's like at home, it's functioning fully and freely.

And again, that's the planet of science, of, you know, the rebel freaky life of the rationality. 

And I've actually never even thought of it that way but it's making me so happy to think of Aquarius as creativity via some level of rationality and also humanitarianism.

Uranus is very much, and the 11th house is the house of, you know, efforts that aren't just masturbatory, you know what I mean?

It's not like just so I can like flex my that muscle but it's for, on some level, the greater good and these, you know, the things that you're talking about, connection - about, you know, let's make it not black and white but the in-between so that there can be less division that is very, very much part of your mission in this life.

Man, you have Jupiter in Pisces. Jupiter is the planet that sort of expands everything that it touches and that's going to be your point of kind of like when you're engaged with your Pisces energy, it's going to bless everything that you do in this life.

Like the more we lean into our Jupiter sign, it's just a point of kind of like luck and ease and abundance. 

And so you have Jupiter in Pisces, which is the planet, I'm sorry, which is the sign of all things dreamy, all things romantic, all things even spiritual, you know, it's a very like kind of in the clouds sort of energy but I think that's of such a nice balance to all of that sort of like rational and really intentional pointed focus in your chart. What else do you have going on here?

You have a conjunction between Mercury and your Midheaven.

Midheaven is the apex of our chart, it's where your 10th house begins, 10th house of public facing image, fame, honors, all of those things and you have, it's really like what our career is in life, but career not in terms of your job, in terms of like what you do that, yeah, it's sort of like public facing in a way that could get you seen and yours is making almost an exact conjunction to Mercury, which is the planet of thinking and communication. 

So that says that what you think and what you communicate is meant in this lifetime, again, to just be seen, you really, you need to be publishing things more and put things out.

More dinners! Yeah, I mean, it's actually crazy like before this together, you're just like, yeah, you know, I put something out every once in a while on this and I think there's a really strong instinct in you because you're even saying, I want to share things and what, I mean, look at what's happening with your data breach or your data deletion, is you're realizing that everything that you don't share maybe won't even exist, you know, that's so the message of your chart, like you are meant to fucking share in this lifetime and not just around a dinner table, you're meant to do that, but really you should be in some way engaged with a bigger audience in life or that's a lot of potential wasted.

I mean, and that's a lot of pressure, I know, but you've got this because you have Mars, Sextile, Saturn, and Mars, also what's so nice is you have Mars and Aquarius, so Mars is the planet of passion, aggression, sexuality, our drive, like everything that just like motivates us in life, like the fire, for better or for worse, and yours, again, is in Aquarius, this sign of breaking molds, bringing in the future, creativity through rationality, and Mars there just gives you superpowers in that area, you know, and Mars being Sextile to Saturn, it means that Mars was making basically like a triangle aspect to where Saturn was in the sky at the time you were born and Saturn is the planet of structure, of tradition, of, it's like the daddy of the planets, you know what I mean, it's the thing that like has a strong foundation, it's challenging, but it's worth it, and so having Mars, Sextile, Saturn is one of those things we've seen a chart where it's like whatever you actually put your will towards, which you have a lot, you have a very strong will, you have the gift of really building things in this lifetime, you know, and seeing it through, and that's so nice when you have a chart that's very, you know, all that Aquarius energy, all that Scorpion energy that could just get sort of lost in Jupiter and Pisces, like in outer space land, you actually have the potential and it's all there of manifesting that in a very tangible way, which is so nice to see because a lot of times there's just like a lot of creativity but there's no structure for it. 

And you have Mars squaring Pluto and your Pluto, I'm sorry, is in Scorpio, yeah.

So on some hand, Mars, the planet of aggression, passion, drive, sexuality, there's tension between that and Pluto, which is the planet of intensity, transformation.

So I think Mars, on one hand, is trying to get things done, and Pluto in your chart is maybe a little too prone to tearing it down. If that makes sense.

And that will be, you know, whenever you have a square and a chart, that's something that's like a challenge that is meant to become one of your greatest gifts.

So Mars and Pluto, those are like the most potent planets that there are. 

They're planets of intensity and it can be a massive challenge or it can be something that's ultimately your greatest gift because when you resolve Mars, square Pluto, you get basically a Mars trine Pluto, which is just power, potency, drive,
transformation in a way that is super aligned and it's like superpowers, yeah. 

Moon trine Jupiter, oh also you have your moon in Cancer. 

Did she talk to you about your moon in Cancer? 

Oh, the best.

So your moon is in, am I saying too much? 

XXX

Your moon is in..., 
so our moon is sort of our inner world. 

If the sun is our ego, what this whole chart is revolving around in a way, like we're on earth revolving around the sun, the sun has that level of importance in a chart, but the moon is, you know, the reflective body in our chart. 

So it's sort of our inner world. 

It's what we need to be in touch with in order to feel emotionally regulated and like emotionally at ease in the world.

It's something more like kind of on a daily basis level. 

You should be engaged with the needs of your moon. 

Otherwise, it's the sort of thing where people tend to feel a bit like just off or out of sorts.

So if the moon is like our emotional inner world, you have your moon in Cancer, which is a super powerful placement because the moon is ruled by Cancer.

So this is another thing just like having Uranus in your eleventh house. 

It's another placement where the planet is right at home there, or in this case, the moon, not the planet.

And what that usually means when people have moon in Cancer is you have this extreme sensitivity, very emotionally intuitive, very empathic, but it's definitely a double-edged sword.

Like it's one of your, it's a part of your magic in this life is to be this emotional being, which again is such a nice balance to a lot of that Aquarius energy, which can maybe get a little disconnected from the feeling and the connection part, but you have the feeling and the connection as well with that moon in Cancer. 

And so it's really the biggest thing about moon in Cancer is knowing how to and being very conscious of not taking on other people's energy.

You're going to take it on either way, but moon in Cancer absolutely needs a way to like at a certain point put on the Cancer like crab shell and like totally discharge yourself of other people's energy.

And it's probably something that like at this point in your life you have some practice of doing. 

You find most people like it in tune with their moons in a pretty natural way like that.

And it's in your sixth house. 

We also have our moon in our sixth house. 

The sixth house is the house of kind of like daily routines and rituals. 

It's the house of health of service.

It's a very sensitive place to have your moon in a physical sort of way. 

So if you have your moon already in this like emotionally very feeling like a large capacity for empathy and feeling, then you also have this level of like your nervous system is very sensitive with moon in the sixth house. 

And what is going on with your emotional state is going to affect your physical state and vice versa even more than with most people.

But what's so nice is you have your moon trining Jupiter and that just adds this big dose. 

So like okay, moon is our emotional world. 

Jupiter is the planet that expands and blesses and like sweetens what it touches and makes it abundant.

And so moon trine Jupiter is one of the nicest things that you can see in an astrology chart because it means that there's something emotionally abundant about you in a really positive way, in a way that just like makes people feel good, in a way that makes you feel good, in a way that sort of like blesses your path because you have this dose of exuberance about your being in a sensitive sort of way that is a gift.

Very nice chart. 

The best chart reading ever, ever. 

You're the best. She knows a lot. 

Just the tutorial. 
All in this triangle. 
Wow. She knows a lot.


It's amazing. It's just astrology, you know. And you have Venus trine Jupiter, so you really have a lot of good luck in your chart, you know, you have a lot of luck.

Like Mars Square Pluto is a challenge for sure. 

Mars Square Pluto is like there is, you have such intensity and that's a thing that you have to fucking figure out what to do with all of that, you know what I mean?

Intensity in whatever way. If it's passion, if it's aggression, if it's sexuality, however that manifests, your intensity is one of your greatest gifts but also something that over time you're going to, you know, learn through trial and error of like, wow, this really didn't work. 

This really didn't work. 

And it's going to be a trial and error situation where your moon trine Jupiter is just something that comes naturally to you.

You were born with this like, okay, got it, you know, under your belt. 

So that's the biggest thing but it's also, it has so much potential for, yeah, just like potency.

But get your shit out there. That is big. That's crazy to me.

You have more 10th house placements but I think honestly because you have so much energy in your 10th house of an awareness of what it feels like to be seen publicly, I think maybe that can even be a little bit paralyzing, you know, because you have such an awareness of, you know, putting out your work feels like someone dining off of your body because the 10th house is serious business for you in this life.

Being seen and being on, putting your work on display in a very public way is a big deal for you in this life. 

So it's not just like, honestly, I think people who have less 10th house placements sometimes don't have such an issue with just being like, oh, sure, just release it. 


Just put it out, you know? But for you, it carries a lot of weight because it's very much a part of your purpose, you know, if I had to say.


Get it out there. Wow. Yeah. 

Thank you, Victoria. 

Thank you, yeah. 

Thanks for everything. 

I'm amazed. I'm amazed. 

It's so nice. So much of my wonderful car.

A fresh perspective. 

Yeah. You've got shit out there. Yeah. Very much. 

You should be seen. We have to go for a date. Where else? This is so my label.

Definitely on my label. 
Everything they were playing in the record store today was this. Something like this? Mm-hmm. No, I like it. Yeah. You really should check it out at school.

I fucked it. I fucked it. I fucked it. What? I stagedived multiple times during a gig during my show in Padova. And I fucked it completely. Fucked it.

What do you mean? What happened to the knee? He has no idea. Stagedived. He fell many times from very high up. I mean, I was as impressed as I was horrified and I was very horrified.
I was slightly less impressed than I was horrified. Yeah, of course. How was the show? It was cool. It was a big show. Big show. Not my thing. My people.
